New Features
============

The releases and release notes are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/releases>`__.
Use HACS to install different versions of pyscript.

You can also install the master (head of tree) version from GitHub, either using HACS or manually.
Because pyscript has quite a few unit tests, generally master should work ok. But it's not guaranteed
to work at any random time.

The latest release is 1.0.0, released on November 9, 2020.  Here is the `stable documentation <https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`__
for that release.

Since that release, the master (head of tree) version in GitHub has several new features and bug fixes.
Here is the master `latest documentation <https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__.

- use ``aionofity`` to auto-reload newly written script files, at least on linux (#74)
- consider allowing native Python functions inside pyscript (#71)
- consider implementing function decorators (#43)
