New Features
============

The releases and release notes are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/releases>`__.
Use HACS to install different versions of pyscript.

You can also install the master (head of tree) version from GitHub, either using HACS or manually.
Because pyscript has quite a few unit tests, generally the master version should work ok. But it's not
guaranteed to work at any random time, and newly-added features might change.

The latest release is 1.1.0, released on December 10, 2020.  Here is the `stable documentation
<https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`__ for that release.

Over time, the master (head of tree) version in GitHub will include new features and bug fixes.
Here is the `latest documentation <https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__ if you want
to see the development version of the documentation.

If you want to see development progress since 1.1.0, see
`new features <https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/new_features.html>`__
in the latest documentation.
