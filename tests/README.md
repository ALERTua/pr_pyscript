# Pyscript tests

For running the tests, you should setup a python virtualenv in the project root directory:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install needed dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements_test.txt
```

Now you can run the tests using this command:
```bash
pytest
```

Always remember to activate the virtualenv before running anything: 
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
